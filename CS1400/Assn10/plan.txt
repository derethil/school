System Requirements
    This program will print out a single chessboard at a user-specified coordinate with a default length and width.
    The user can optionally speciify a custom length and width if they want.

System Analysis
    The program will use a main function in assn10.py and import everything else from chessboard.py.

System Design
    1. Ask user for coordinate
    2. Ask user for optional length and/or width
    3. Use drawChessboard function
