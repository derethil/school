# System Analysis
# This program will ask for the name, hours worked, and hourly wage of an employee as well as the 
# state and federal reductions in their taxes. It will calculate gross pay, federal reductions, 
# state reductions, and net pay before printing it out.

# System Design
# 1. Ask for employee's name
# 2. Ask for employee's hours worked
# 3. Ask for employee's hourly wage
# 4. Ask for federal tax reduction percentage
# 5. Ask for state tax reduction percentage
# 6. Create an output string
# 7. Format the output string with augmented operators and format() function
#   7b. Calculate gross pay using hours worked * hourly wage
#   7c. Calculate federal and state deductions using reduction rate * gross pay
#   8d. Calculate net pay by subtracting both reductions from gross pay
# 8. Print the output
