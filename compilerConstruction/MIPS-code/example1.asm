# A demonstration of some simple MIPS instructions

	# Declare main as a global function
	.globl main 

	# All program code is placed after the
	# .text assembler directive
	.text 		

# The label 'main' represents the starting point
main:
	li $t2 25
	lw $t3 value
	add $t4 $t2 $t3
	move $a0 $t4
	li $v0 1  # 1 means "print int"
	syscall

	# Exit the program by means of a syscall.
	# There are many syscalls - pick the desired one
	# by placing its code in $v0. The code for exit is "10"
	li $v0, 10 # Sets $v0 to "10" to select exit syscall
	syscall # Exit

	# All memory structures are placed after the
	# .data assembler directive
	.data

	# The .word assembler directive reserves space
	# in memory for a single 4-byte word (or multiple 4-byte words)
	# and assigns that memory location an initial value
	# (or a comma separated list of initial values)
value:	.word 12
